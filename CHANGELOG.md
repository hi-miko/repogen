# CHANGELOG

Implementation `TODO`:

- Figure out how to "bake" licenses into the script, so that they are always available, or add them to a permanent predetermined location. 
Currently the scripts looks for specific files that are defined at the `LICENSE REDIRECT` part of the code (could also fix that so its a 
variable).
- Add more options, like what folders/files to add
- Add and commit already existing specified files (ie something already made, would be added in the initial commit)
- Extensively check and test arguments/flags
